# Neovim Config

**THIS IS OUT OF DATE, HEAD ON OVER TO MY [DOTFILES](https://github.com/anders-14/dotfiles) TO SEE THE MOST UP TO DATE CONFIG**

This is where is store my neovim configuration files. I'm no expert,
so take inspiration at your own risk.

I currently use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my plugins.

I'm also on neovim nightly, so some of the stuff might not work if you're not. Things like
lsp, treesitter and telescope. You have been warned...

## Nice base16 themes

I'm writing them down. That way i don't have to scroll through them all looking for that one
the I was thinking about.

- brewer
- bright
- flat
- google-dark
- helios
